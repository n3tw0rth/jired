# Jired

_Yeah, it is a weird name_

A command-line tool for logging time across multiple time tracking platforms including Jira, Clockify, and more.

## Overview

Jired, a plugin-based CLI application that allows developers to log time directly from their terminal. The application provides a seamless experience for tracking time spent on tasks, regardless of which time tracking service your organization uses.

**Status: ðŸš§ Currently in active development**

## Features

- Simple command-line interface for time tracking
- Multiple time logging providers:
  - Jira
  - Clockify
  - _More coming soon_
- Fuzzy search tasks
- Natural language-like arguments
- Report generation

## Installation

```bash
# Wait!, The project is still in development
```

## Quick Start

Once installed, you can begin tracking time with the following commands:

```bash
# Start a task
jj start <project-code> <fuzzy-text>

# End a task
jj stop

# Task with start and end time
jj start <project-code> <fuzzy-text> from 1800 till 1935 // end time is 07:35 PM

# if from is not specified, the start time is set to the current time
# if from is specified, but till is not, the end time will not be set

# default scope is set to "today" and any time log will be added to the current day
# the scope can be changed to any date using the following syntax
jj set <data> // data format is yyyy-mm-dd
```

## Provider Plugins (WIP)

- **Jira**: Log work directly to Jira issues
- **Clockify**: Track time in Clockify

-- Providers can be combined, logging to multiple providers at once

## Configuration

Create a configuration file at `~/.config/ttrack/config.toml`:
